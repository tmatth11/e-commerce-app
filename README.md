The E-Commerce App is a full-stack application built with the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). It features user authentication with JSON Web Tokens, protected routes for both buyers and sellers, and a database that manages users, products, and shopping carts. Sellers can add, update, and delete products, while buyers can view products, add them to their shopping cart, and checkout. The application is meant to be a personal project to learn more about full-stack development with the PERN stack.

The app is built with the following technologies:
- **Frontend**: React + Vite, Bootstrap 5
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js PostgreSQL

To start the app, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Run `npm install` in both the client and server directories to install the dependencies.

3. Run `docker compose up` in the server directory to start the PostgreSQL database with Docker.

4. Run `npm run start` in the server directory to start the Express.js server.

5. Run `npm run dev` in the client directory to start the Vite development server.
